# charter-express
A website for a company to list their chartered trips for customers view and join

There are companies that contact cruise lines and vacation companies and makes deals to gather groups of people to go on those trips.

The project would be building a website for a company to list their avaiable charter trips for people to view and apply to go on those trips. 

When a person signs up for a specific charter a request record will be created and an email sent to the company that posted the charter. The company representative would then need to log in to the website and approve the requests.

**Business:** The model would be subscription based for the companies using the service. The people using the website as customers would use the site for free. We could either offer unique websites for each company or act as a repository for all companies on one site.

**Legal:** When in production the code would be closed source/proprietary. 

**Technical:** The technology used for the project would either be reactjs or vuejs for the front end. For the backend we would use expressjs for the server and MySQL for relational DB.

**Options for NoSQL:** MongoDB, DynamoDB, firebaseDB, CouchDB
